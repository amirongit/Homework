# Homework
An educational platform, designed for teachers to expose their courses to the world, and for students to take their desired courses.

## What's the logic behind it?!
Any one could sing up in Homework as an **student** or a **teacher**. Teachers are able to define courses, and also, define presentations for their courses so they can teach a single course more than once. With that said, students are able to take courses by attending in one of their presentations. as simple as that! :)
